First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest thanks to my advisor, Dr. Simon Lucey. His patient guidance, continued encouragement,
and immense knowledge were key motivating factors throughout my masters. His insights on what the right tool would be to solve a particular problem really helped me hone my own intuition as a researcher and helped guide me through my masters.\\\\
It also has been an absolute privilege to work with and learn from all the brilliant people in my masters program cohort. I have had the good fortune to meet the most helpful and humble people at CMU RI.\\\\
Last, but not the least, I would like to express my gratitude and indebtedness
to my family for their love and support. Their support
and hope brought me here in the first place.
